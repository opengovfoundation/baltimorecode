retaliatory actions on the part of landlords be proscribed.  The sanctions are intended to
protect the life, health and safety of tenants and are not to be used to have premises

the City Engineer, the Annex Improvement Commission, or any other public commission, board or
agency, the obligation to pay for the cost of such paving within the space covered by any such
railroad or railway track or tracks and for a distance of two feet outside of each outer rail of such
track or tracks.  The cost of the paving, as herein used, shall be construed to include the cost of the
removal of the old cobble or other paving, and all excavation, ballasting, grading, concreting and
other work involved in such paving.  This obligation shall apply whether the entire street be paved
with the same kind of improved paving or whether one kind be put outside of the railway area and a
different kind within the railway area, provided, no more expensive material or construction be used
in the railway area than is reasonably necessary, in the judgment of the Paving Commission or other
agency doing such paving, for the proper construction of the paving of the entire street.  The Paving
Commission, or other public agency, having in charge the construction of such paving, may permit
said corporation to do any part of the work within the railway area which said Commission or other
agency may consider can be done by said corporation without detriment to the public welfare or the
proper progress of the work.  In order to give such corporation an opportunity to do any part or parts
of the work which it may be authorized to do by said Commission or other agency, the said
Commission or other agency, before beginning work upon any portion of a street occupied by a
railroad or railway track or tracks, shall give to the corporation owning, operating and using such
track or tracks reasonable notice of its intention to do such work and of the time when it proposes to
begin such work on such street.  The said Commission or other agency, shall an accurate account of

corporation.</para>
<para></para>
<para>The obligation hereby imposed shall be a lien upon the property of such corporation to the same
extent as ordinary taxes against the property of such corporation, and may be enforced and collected
by the same remedies used for the enforcement and collection of taxes, and payment thereof may be
enforced by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore by a suit at law or by any other remedy
provided by any law or ordinance, and appropriate for said purpose.  All said remedies shall be
cumulative.  The City, through its Paving Commission, or other Commission, board or agency doing
such paving, may pay the cost of the paving in the railway or railroad area in the first instance, and in
that event the said cost when paid by the railway or railroad corporation shall be credited to the fund
from which the cost of said paving shall have been paid in the first instance; and the amount of the
cost shall be due and payable for the work done in the railway area in any street or portion of a street
embraced in each separate contract or separate undertaking of construction by said Paving
Commission or other agency, upon the completion of such work.  Provided, that no corporation shall
be required to pay under or by virtue of the provisions of this subheading more than $100,000 during

shall exceed $100,000 in any one year, the excess above $100,000 shall not be due and payable until

subheading shall be paid by every corporation upon which it is imposed, but that no corporation shall
be called on to pay more than $100,000 thereof in any one year.</para>
