hereafter becomes a member of the Employees&#8217; Retirement System may, at any time, resign from
said system and be entitled, on demand, to the return of his accumulated contributions.</para>

he continued to hold such elective or appointive office.  Such payments shall be based on the
current rate of compensation such person would have received, had he remained in office.
Within 30 days following the end of the term of office for which said official was last elected or
appointed, in order to exercise such option, said official shall be required to deposit the
remainder of all the payments in advance for the current fiscal year which would have been paid
had he continued to hold such elective or appointive office.  Thereafter, such payments shall be

<para></para>
<para>   (1)Class A members shall be all new employees before July 1, 1979, who enter the
membership on or after January 1, 1954, and any members in service on January 1, 1954,
who elect on a form approved by the Board, to contribute at a rate of contribution
computed to provide an annuity at age 60 of 1/120 of average final compensation,
multiplied by the number of years of service after March 31, 1954.  Any school crossing
guard, police department meter monitor or linemen transferred to this system pursuant to
&#167; 30(2) of this article shall be classified in this system as a Class A member, and shall not
be charged with any deficit resulting from the difference in contribution rates between the
Fire and Police Employees&#8217; Retirement System and this system in the calculation of said
member&#8217;s retirement allowance at the time of retirement.  The pension at service
retirement on account of each year of prior service for Class A members shall be 1/60 of
average final compensation, and the pension on account of each year of service since
January 1, 1926 shall be 1/120 of average final compensation.</para>

<para>   (2)Class B members shall be members in service on January 1, 1954, who do not elect, prior
to April 1, 1954, to contribute at the higher rate applicable to Class A members.  The
term &#8220;Class B members&#8221; also includes those members in service who do not become
Class A members pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.  The pension at service
retirement on account of each year of prior service for Class B members shall be 1/65 of
average final compensation, and the pension on account of each year of service since
January 1, 1926, shall be 1/130 of average final compensation.  Any time on or after
December 1, 1975, any Class B member in the Retirement System may elect to become a
Class A member.  Such election shall be contingent upon said member&#8217;s depositing, by a
lump sum payment or by an increased rate of contribution, the amount necessary to obtain
an annuity savings account balance equal to the balance such account would contain if
said member had elected to become a Class A member on January 1, 1954.  Said
payments by the member to obtain Class A membership shall be paid in full 90 days
before the effective date of his retirement.</para>

all service in any 12-month period, nor shall the Board of Trustees allow credit as service for
any period of more than 1 month&#8217;s duration during which the employee was absent without
pay.  In the case of former members of the General Assembly of Maryland who become or
who have become members of the Retirement System, each full year of membership in the
General Assembly shall be credited as a year of service, regardless of whether payment for
such service was on a per diem or per annum basis.  In any event, a member who vacated or
otherwise relinquished his position as a member of the General Assembly before the end of
the term for which he was elected, shall be given full credit up to the date of his separation

<para>The annual compensation of each member taken into account under this subtitle shall not exceed
the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (&#8220;OBRA &#8217;93&quot;) annual compensation

increases under Internal Revenue Code &#167; 401(a)(17)(B) and subject to the fresh start provisions
set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar
year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the
&#8220;determination period&#8221;) beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of
fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the
denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into
account in determining a member&#8217;s retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for
that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA &#8217;93 annual compensation limit for that
prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1,

system.  Such official shall be eligible to receive credit for all previous service as an elected
official of Baltimore City, and any service credit for membership in any Maryland State or City of
Baltimore retirement system provided that he files a claim with the Board of Trustees within 6
months after becoming a member, and shall pay to this Retirement System, by a single payment

in the Employees&#8217; Retirement System, and any service credit for membership in any Maryland
State, or Baltimore City retirement system.  In order to receive such credit for such membership,
within 6 months after becoming a member, the elected official shall pay to this Retirement System
by a single payment or increased rate of contribution, as might be approved by the Board of
Trustees, the contributions with regular interest that he would have paid for such membership
credit had he been a contributing Class A member of the Employees&#8217; Retirement System.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)Any elected official who is a C member of the Employees&#8217; Retirement System shall have the
option, within 120 days of his taking his oath of office, to become a member of this Retirement
System, and he shall be entitled to receive credit in this Retirement System, for all service credit
he had acquired while a C member in the Employees&#8217; Retirement System, and any service credit
for membership in any Maryland State, or Baltimore City retirement system.  In order to receive
such credit for membership, within 6 months after becoming a member, the elected official shall
pay to this Retirement System by a single payment or increased rate of contribution, as might be
approved by the Board of Trustees, the contributions with regular interest that he would have paid
for such membership credit had he been a contributing Class A member of the Employees&#8217;
Retirement System.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (b) (1)An elected official may not make contributions to, receive any pension or retirement allowance
from, or accrue any service credit in any other pension or retirement system of the City of
Baltimore while at the same time accruing service credit in this system.</para>

<para>  (3)Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, and pursuant to &#167; 48 of this article, the
following shall become members of this system and accrue service credit in this system while
employed in a permanent full-time or permanent part-time position covered by this system:</para>
<para></para>
<para>    (i)members of another City system who were eligible to begin receiving retirement benefits
from that system but who chose to postpone receipt of those benefits and change
employment to a position covered by this system (including former members of the
Employees&#8217; Retirement System with entitlement to deferred vested pension benefits from
that system, who ceased all permanent full-time or permanent part time employment
covered by that system); or</para>
<para></para>
<para>    (ii)retirees who were receiving retirement benefits form another City system but who chose
to suspend receipt of those benefits and accept reemployment in a position covered by this
system.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any elected official who is a member of this retirement
system has the right at his or her option to continue membership in the retirement system after his or
her leaving office or the end of the term of office for which he or she was last elected. This right is
contingent on that person&#8217;s making all the payments that would have been made by him or her and
also by the City, as determined by the actuary, had he or she continued to hold the elected office.
These payments shall be based on the current annual earnable rate of compensation that the person
would have received had he or she remained in office.  However, to the extent that any elected
official leaves office to begin employment in a position covered by another City system and begins to
accrue service credit in that other system, pursuant to &#167; 48 of this article, that former elected official
may not choose to continue active membership in this system.</para>
<para></para>
<para> To exercise this option, the elected official is required to deposit the remainder of all the payments in
advance, within 30 days after leaving office or the end of the term of office for which the elected
official served, for the current fiscal year that would have been paid had he or she continued to hold
office.  Thereafter, payments shall be made in annual amounts, in advance within 30 days of the
beginning of each fiscal year.  These payments entitle the official to the same service credit that he or
she was receiving as a member before leaving office.  On accruing 12 years of membership credits
and 50 years of age or more or 16 years of membership credits the elected official is entitled to
receive a service retirement allowance as provided for in &#167; 22(a) of this subtitle, computed as if he or
she were a member retiring from active service.  Should a member so electing die before he or she
becomes eligible for any benefits under this subtitle, the amount of his or her accumulated
contributions with interest to the date of death shall be paid to his or her estate, or to the person that
she or he nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the Board of Trustees
at the time of retirement.  The deceased member&#8217;s beneficiary or estate is not entitled to any benefit
under this subtitle other than the return of the deceased member&#8217;s accumulated contributions.</para>

<para> (d)Any elected official may remain in service as a contributing member regardless of age.  However, no
contributions shall be made by the member after the member has attained age 60 and has acquired 35
years of service credit in this system.</para>

the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (&#8220;OBRA &#8217;93&#8221;) annual compensation
limit.  The OBRA &#8217;93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, adjusted for cost of living
increases under Internal Revenue Code &#167; 401(a)(17)(B) and subject to the fresh start provisions
set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar
year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the
&#8220;determination period&#8221;) beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of
fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the
denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into
account in determining a member&#8217;s retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for
that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA &#8217;93 annual compensation limit for that

future.  &#167;&#167; 37 and 42 to the contrary notwithstanding, any benefit increase provided under
this section is not and does not become an obligation of the City of Baltimore.  In the event of
