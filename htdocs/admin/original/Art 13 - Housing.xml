<para>(a)  <emphasis role="italic">Rental housing shortage.</emphasis></para>
<para></para>
<para>The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore hereby finds and declares that a rental housing
shortage presently exists in 2 areas of Baltimore City of emergency proportions which has been
caused, in large part, by the conversion of rental housing to condominiums.  In addition, at the
present time the number of conversions to condominium regimes is accelerating at a rapid rate.</para>
<para></para>
<para>(b)  <emphasis role="italic">Conversions exacerbating shortage.</emphasis></para>
<para></para>
<para>These increasing numbers of conversions exacerbate an already severe shortage of moderate
rental housing in the City while the poor economic conditions in the building trades have almost
halted the construction of new rental units.  As a result, the Mayor and City Council finds that the
combination of the conversion of existing rental units and the lack of construction of new rental
units has resulted in an extreme scarcity of rental housing in the City and insufficient numbers of
rental units available to low and moderate income tenants.</para>
<para></para>
<para>(c) <emphasis role="italic"> Hardships on displaced tenants.</emphasis></para>
<para></para>
<para>The Mayor and City Council further finds that conversions of rental units has resulted in the
displacement of tenants and caused these tenants severe financial and emotional stress in their
need to relocate.  Studies have shown that elderly and handicapped tenants suffer serious
emotional and physical disturbances when they are advised that their buildings are being
converted into condominiums.</para>
