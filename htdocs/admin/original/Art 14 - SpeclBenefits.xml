<para></para>
<para> (a)  In general.</para>
<para></para>
<para>The following findings are critical to the exercise of the authority set forth in Article II, &#167; (61) of
the Charter of Baltimore.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (b)  Importance of Downtown.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)The downtown or central business district (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) of the City of Baltimore is the center of
employment for the entire metropolitan region and is the source for a very substantial portion
of all jobs within the City.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)The CBD is also the center for tourism for the entire State of Maryland, having within its
boundaries some of the most popular attractions in the country.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)The CBD is an important part of the tax base of the City, contributing taxes totally
disproportionate to the relative area involved.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)The CBD is a vital link to the long-term health of the City and the focus of critical decisions
as to the source of employment for the future.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (c)  Problems facing CBD.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)While an undeniable asset to the region, the CBD is very dependent on public perception
regarding safety and cleanliness.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)Studies conducted by a task force of the Partnership have identified the existence of
significant concern among CBD residents and workers of being a victim of crime, despite
statistics indicating that the CBD is as safe or safer than other parts of the City.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)Because of the high influx of workers and visitors, the CBD is likely to generate higher
amounts of trash, litter, and graffiti than other parts of the City.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)In order to maintain the CBD as an attractive destination for visitors, there need to be efforts
made to improve the perceptions regarding safety and cleanliness.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (5)Traditional sources of funding, enhancing public services, are no longer available, and a
variety of financial crises have suggested that future funding from existing sources will
become ever more difficult.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (d)  Concept of Special Benefit District.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)A special benefit district is a mechanism by which property owners within a defined area can
agree to impose additional taxes and charges on themselves in order to provide enhanced and
supplemental public services.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)Special benefit districts have been created in numerous cities across the country, and the
reports received suggest that they are almost uniformly highly successful in achieving their
objectives.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)Critical to any special benefit district is the creation of a partnership between the public and
private sector, with the public sector committing to maintain services at specified levels and
the private sector agreeing to accept new taxes and charges for the purpose of supplementing
public services.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)A district in this City cannot be successful without the full cooperation of the City, the State
of Maryland, and the various private property owners within that district.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (e)  Considerations.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)The Council has considered the materials compiled by the Downtown Partnership of
Baltimore, Inc., regarding the alternatives to the creation of a district and the pattern of
success for such districts elsewhere.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)The Council has considered the comments and suggestions of property owners, retail
merchants, hotel and motel operators and owners, property tenants, and workers in the CBD.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)The Council finds that a special benefit district of the kind authorized by the Enabling
Legislation would be an important and vital element of the long-term health and growth of
the CBD, the City, and the region.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)Although 1 or more districts would be of great value throughout the CBD, the district created
herein will be a significant start towards achieving the goals and objectives outlined above.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (5)Since 1982, the Partnership has been responsible for the management and operation of
ever-increasing parts of the CBD, and has demonstrated its ability to deal with the kinds of
problems such a district needs to address.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (6)The City should not burden a district with unnecessary layers of administration, nor should
the City deny itself the benefit of the experience and expertise acquired by the Partnership.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (7)The Council finds that the existing system of assessments, appeals, and adjustments for
vacancies on income-producing properties adequately addresses the concerns raised in the
Enabling Legislation.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (8)The Council finds that an assessment system for a district should be uncomplicated, direct,
and fair. The system provided for in this subtitle satisfies such criteria.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (9)The Council finds that the district should encourage the involvement of minorities in the
operation of the district and in the business community itself.</para>

<para>Waterfront Management District</para>
<para></para>
<para>&#167; 8-1.  Findings.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (a)  Importance of Inner Harbor and Waterfront.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)The Inner Harbor of the Patapsco River is the civic, financial, and symbolic heart of
Baltimore City.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)The area fronting on the Inner Harbor (the &#8220;Waterfront&#8221;) is home to many of Baltimore&#8217;s
largest employers.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)The Inner Harbor is the center of tourism for the City and State, attracting over 12 million
visitors a year.  It was the development of the Inner Harbor that first spawned the creation
of a tourism industry in Baltimore, now considered to be the Baltimore area&#8217;s seventh
largest employer.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)The Waterfront is an important part of the City&#8217;s tax base; the Inner Harbor alone
contributed over $60 million in tax revenues to the City in 2005.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (5)The Waterfront is the site of some of the region&#8217;s largest real estate investments and, as a
result of the location and quality of development, many office tenants and residents are
relocating here from outside the City.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (6)The Waterfront is a critical link to the long term health of the City and region.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (b)  Opportunities facing City.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)The Waterfront is undeniably a tremendous asset to the region.  Still, to remain competitive
as a destination, the Waterfront must be on a par with first-class destinations around the
world.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)A study conducted by the Greater Baltimore Committee in 2005 concluded that &#8220;the Inner
Harbor suffered from a complete lack of focus and attention to the quality of its facilities,
supervision of responsibilities, and maintenance of the integrity of the harbor and its
activities&#8221;.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)More specifically, the study focused on two key deficiencies: (i) the lack of a single person,
government, or quasi-governmental entity that is charged with the specific oversight of the
management and operation of the Harbor; and (ii) the lack of money or the influence to
secure the needed manpower and equipment resources necessary to maintain the care and
upkeep of the Inner Harbor properly.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)In 2006, a Task Force recommended that a business improvement or special benefits district
be created that would advocate for, participate in, and financially support City and private
sector efforts to create and maintain a world-class system of public and private parks,
promenades, and open spaces in the Inner Harbor.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (5)In order to establish the Waterfront as a world-class destination, additional steps must be
taken to create a consistently clean, attractive, easy to navigate, and appealing experience
for residents, workers, and visitors along Baltimore&#8217;s waterfront area.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (c)  Special Benefit Districts.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)A special benefit district is a mechanism by which property owners within a defined area
can agree to impose additional taxes and charges on themselves in order to provide
enhanced and supplemental public services.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)Critical to the success of a benefit district is the creation of a partnership between the public
and private sector, with the public sector committing to maintain services at specified levels
and the private sector agreeing to accept new taxes and charges for the purpose of
supplementing public services.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)This kind of a district in Baltimore cannot be successful without the full cooperation of
the City, the State of Maryland, and the various private property owners within the district. </para>
<para></para>
<para> (d)  Council considerations.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)The City Council has considered the materials presented that reflect the compelling
reasons for creation of a special benefits district.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)The Council has considered the comments and suggestions of property owners, retail
merchants, hotel operators and owners, office property tenants, service providers, and
neighborhood organizations that represent interests along the Waterfront area.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)The Council has considered the fact that, while the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore,
Inc., has operated successfully along the waterfront for approximately 18 months and has
provided noticeable improvements to the attractiveness of the Waterfront and the overall
experience for visitors to the Waterfront, the ability to provide a consistent set of services and
to maintain a high quality standard requires a consistent and reliable funding stream.  The
assessment system for a benefit district provides an uncomplicated, direct and fair funding
process.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (4)The Council has given consideration to and made the findings required by City Charter
Article II, &#167; 63.</para>

under this subtitle, encompassing a concentration of business establishments.</para>

<para></para>
<para> (a)  In general.</para>
<para></para>
<para> The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore makes the following declaration of its legislative
intent in the enactment of this subtitle.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (b)  Neighborhood districts serve invaluable function.</para>
<para></para>
<para> Neighborhood retail shopping districts in Baltimore City, when maintained and operated
properly, serve invaluable functions in City life.  They provide a convenient marketplace for
neighborhood residents and play an important role in the identity of the community.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (c)  Suburban centers threaten neighborhood districts.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (1)The growth of suburban shopping centers has threatened many neighborhood retail business
districts.  Many cannot satisfactorily compete with new facilities that offer convenience,
adequate parking, pleasing physical environment, diversification of retail services, and a
management system that provides for promotional activities and for enhanced sanitation and
security services.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)Retail sales in these neighborhood shopping areas have decreased, and the loss of revenue has
caused a gradual disinvestment in the commercial properties, vacancies and, in the worst
cases, abandonment by property owners.  This disinvestment negatively affects the
surrounding residential community, results in the loss of jobs and property taxes to the City
and requires the City to assume responsibility for these properties.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (d)  Commercial Revitalization Program begun.</para>
<para></para>
<para> To counter this trend Baltimore City established the Commercial Revitalization Program. 
Selected neighborhood shopping districts were targeted for public improvements which would
enhance the physical appearance of the area.  In return, retail merchants and commercial property
owners were required to rehabilitate their properties in conformance with a unified design
developed for the area.</para>
<para></para>
<para> (e)  Management program needed.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (1)However, in order for neighborhood business districts to compete more efficiently for
business with suburban shopping centers, funds and a management system are necessary to
provide advertising and promotional activities and enhanced sanitation and security services
for the entire district.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (2)The Commercial Revitalization Program has always been founded on self-help by the
business community.  The merchant associations in neighborhood business districts are
voluntary organizations of business persons who have limited time to plan and implement a
management program and limited capacity to raise funds.  They have indicated to the City a
strong need for such a management program and fund raising mechanism.</para>
<para></para>
<para>  (3)The management program created in this subtitle will harness the energies of the business
community and provide it with the necessary funding through a Retail Business District
License Fee.  Furthermore, the proposed program will enable all business establishments
within the boundaries of a given Retail Business District to join in promotional, sanitation,
and public safety efforts not economically feasible for many individual businesses without a
program of this sort.  The City Council finds that this program serves a public purpose and
enhances the general welfare of the citizens of Baltimore City.</para>
